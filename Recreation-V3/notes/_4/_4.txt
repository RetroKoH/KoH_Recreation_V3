Speed Application is now enabled for all control modes, even though only one mode is currently accessible.
The player is now confined within the left and right borders of the room, within 16 pixels.

Rolling has been added, and it works slightly differently to running. First, you cannot actively accelerate.
Secondly, the speeds that are applied are also different:

Running:
accel_speed		0.046875
decel_speed		0.5
friction_speed	0.046875
top_speed		6

Rolling:
decel_speed		0.125		(Friction is applied WITH deceleration while rolling)
friction_speed	0.0234375	(Hardcoded to be half of the running friction speed)

Top Speed
X Speed is capped at 16 while rolling. Inertia and Y Speed are NOT capped, though the angle is adjusted with
proper floor collision, so the player is never misaligned.

Starting a roll (S&K Behavior):
the Player can't begin to roll unless absolute inertia is greater than or equal to 1, in order to crouch
while their absolute inertia is below 1, so they can Spindash without needing to come to a full stop.

To combat the anomaly associated with turning around while rolling, the Player unrolls if absolute inertia
falls below 0.5. If inertia happens to be 0 when they try to initiate a roll, (S-Tunnels, etc), inertia
will be set to 2, in the direction that the player was last moving in.

Rolling Jump behavior has been removed, as mentioned in Note _3.
