Each Solid Tile has a corresponding array of 16 height values ranging from 0 to 16 pixels, inclusive.
They also have a width array for horizontal collisions, used when a horizontal sensor is checks the tile.

Each height value determines a pixel height from the bottom of the tile to the top.
Negative height values determine a height from the top of the tile to the bottom.

Each width value determines a pixel width from the right side of the tile to the left.
Negative width values determine a width from the left side of the tile to the right.

Solid Tiles contain a value which represents the angle of the slope that the Height Array creates.
If the angle value of the tile is 255, it is a flagged tile. Player objects will not set their
angle to the tile's angle, instead setting the angle to the Player's current angle snapped to the
nearest cardinal angle (0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees):
snapped_angle = (round(angle / 90) mod 4) * 90;
This flag applies commonly to full Block Solid Tiles (filled squares).

Some tiles are top-solid only, while others are fully solid. More will be added to this engine later.
