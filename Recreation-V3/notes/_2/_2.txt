Angles in this engine are done in hex, meaning that there are 256 divisions of a circle, instead of 360.
This means that all floor angles range from 0-255. 

Each angle = hex_angle * (360/256); or hex_angle * 1.40625. A table is constructed at the start to convert
every hex angle to an actual angle usable by the engine, along with the corresponding sine, cosine, and
floor mode quadrant. This will remove constant calculation from runtime of the game. This table is found at
the end of setup_Game_Collision()

All collision data used in this game is pulled from Sonic 1. This means that not only are angles in hex,
as noted above, but that angles are inverted (They run clockwise). To counter that, each angle loaded is
subtracted from 256 in order to get the proper hex angle.

Two functions have also been added to allow for value wrapping. A specialized one for angles is also
included. These functions come courtesy of Ralakimus, and the SoniC C port engine. They are found in
Scripts>Game Functions>gfunc_wrap.
