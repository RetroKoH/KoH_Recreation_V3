x_pos		The X-coordinate of the object's centre.
y_pos		The Y-coordinate of the object's centre.
x_spd		The speed at which the object is moving horizontally.
y_spd		The speed at which the object is moving vertically.
inertia		The speed at which the object is moving on the ground.
angle		The object's angle, or angle on the ground.
width		The object's width from the origin pixel, left and right.
height		The object's height from the origin pixel, up and down.

Two values define size for tile collision. width and height.

Any object/tile collision typically only concerns itself with any object's whole pixel position,
ignoring any subpixel amount. Collision calculations can just use a floored position instead of
the real position.

Collision tile data uses angles in hex, 0 through 255, meaning that there are only 256 divisions
of a circle, not 360. In addition, there are no fractional angles between these values.

Each angle value (0-255) in this engine is equivalent to angle * 360/256 (angle * 1.40625).
Sines, Cosines, and Collision modes are precalculated into a table for the angles.

Tile Collision Radii
For all characters, their Push Radius is always 10.
When standing, Sonic's Width Radius is 9 and his Height Radius is 19
	resulting in 19 pixels wide and 39 pixels tall.
When spinning, his Width Radius is 7 and his Height Radius is 14
	resulting in 15 pixels wide and 29 pixels tall.

Object Hitbox Radii (Stored in array hitbox[])
Sonic's object hitbox has an Object Width of 8.
The Object Height is always 3 pixels shorter than the tile height radius, updated regularly.
Sonic's Y Position and Height Radius don't change while crouching. So the game manually updates
the hitbox's size and position while Sonic crouches, where 12 pixels is added to the hitbox's
Y position, and the hitbox's height radius is set to 10. 

Changes to these hitboxes are not yet implemented.
